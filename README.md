### Questions

1.  Introduce yourself and share details about your career start
2.  Give me an example of a situation that required an immediate decision.
3.  Explain in more details the product and which technologies your team were using (and why)
   
### Code Challenge

Given a list of compounded words, the task is to arrange and count every possible pair of words from the list. For example, if we have the following list:

arduinoCopy code

`{"rockstar", "rock", "rockstars", "tar", "star", "rocks"}`

The expected output would be a list of lists:

arduinoCopy code

`{{"rock", "star"}, {"rocks", "tar"}}`

To solve this challenge, you can follow these steps:

1.  Create an empty list to store the pairs.
2.  Iterate through each word in the given list.
3.  For each word, iterate through the remaining words in the list.
4.  Check if combining the current word with the remaining word forms a compound word. If so, add it to the pairs list.
5.  Return the pairs list.
